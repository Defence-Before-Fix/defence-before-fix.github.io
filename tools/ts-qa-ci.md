title: ts-qa-ci and Defence Before Fix
summary: Harness, resolver, derived listing and justified record all hold for the ESLint lane; the dependency-cruiser defence is outside all three, an eslint-suppressions.json silences a bundled defence, and a Tier A rule is never enabled; declares toolchain 0.2.0 at both levels with the gaps recorded

# ts-qa-ci

**Language**: JavaScript and TypeScript · **Kind**: toolchain · **Readiness**: 🟢 · **Detector conformance**: 🟡 · **Toolchain conformance**: 🟡 · **Project conformance**: 🟡 · **Checked**: 2026-09-08, main at commit 46fac6a, declaration merged at ea2020b

ts-qa-ci is an orchestrated QA pipeline for TypeScript and React projects, published as `@longtermsupport/ts-qa-ci` ([repository](https://github.com/LongTermSupport/ts-qa-ci)). One command runs oxlint as a pre-filter, then Prettier, ESLint with a bundled plugin of Component-Driven Development rules, the TypeScript compiler, dependency-cruiser, knip and the test suite, auto-fixing locally and failing the gate on anything it cannot fix. It is the reference toolchain for this specification in the JavaScript ecosystem, and every grade below was checked by running its commands against a fixture rather than by reading its README. Under toolchain specification 0.1.0 it graded conforming; the 0.2.0 document measures every detector a defence is routed through and every suppression route, and on that measure three gaps appear that the earlier document did not ask about.

## Tools it bundles

The pipeline runs in five phases, fail-fast between them. For each tool: whether it can host a bespoke defence under the method, and which of the toolchain's own mechanisms wrap it.

- **Phase 0, fast fail: eslintConfigParity.** A check of the toolchain's own that the project's ESLint configuration matches what the pipeline resolves. Not a defence host. Reported through the pipeline verdict only.
- **Phase 0, fast fail: supplyChain.** A dependency bake-window audit. Not a defence host. Reported through the pipeline verdict only.
- **Phase 0, fast fail: oxlint.** Can host a bespoke defence through its JS plugin mechanism, though ts-qa-ci uses it as a pre-filter with built-in rules only, so no defence is routed through it and it is graded as a check. Its `oxlint-disable` directives are banned by the bundled `ts-qa/no-eslint-disable` rule; `ts-qa rule`, `ts-qa rule-doc` and `ts-qa rules` do not cover oxlint findings.
- **Phase 1, code modification: prettier.** A formatter; cannot host a defence. Not wrapped.
- **Phase 1, code modification: eslintFix.** ESLint in write mode over the same resolved configuration as the report lane; hosts bespoke defences, and is wrapped by all three of `ts-qa rule`, `ts-qa rule-doc` and `ts-qa rules`.
- **Phase 2, lint and validation: eslintReport.** ESLint in report mode; the lane every bundled and bespoke plugin defence runs in, and the one `ts-qa rule` narrows to a single identifier. Wrapped by `ts-qa rule`, `ts-qa rule-doc` and `ts-qa rules`.
- **Phase 2, lint and validation: remarkValidateLinks.** A Markdown link checker; a fixed catalogue, cannot host a defence. Not wrapped.
- **Phase 2, lint and validation: knip.** Unused file, export and dependency detection; a fixed catalogue, cannot host a defence. Not wrapped.
- **Phase 3, static analysis: tsc.** The compiler's fixed catalogue; cannot host a defence. Its `@ts-` directives are banned by `ts-qa/no-eslint-disable`. Not otherwise wrapped.
- **Phase 3, static analysis: dependencyCruiser.** Hosts a bespoke architectural defence in the project's own configuration, and the toolchain ships one of its own, `no-circular`, at error severity. Not wrapped by `ts-qa rule`, `ts-qa rule-doc` or `ts-qa rules`, and the lane ignores `-p`.
- **Phase 4, tests: vitest.** A test runner; cannot host a defence. Runs the toolchain's own self-audit test. Not wrapped.
- **Phase 4, tests: playwright.** An end-to-end test runner; cannot host a defence. Not wrapped.

The three conformance mechanisms cover the ESLint lanes in full and nothing else. That is enough for every defence a practitioner writes as a plugin rule, and it leaves the one bundled dependency-cruiser defence with an identifier that prints, blocks, and leads nowhere.

## How it is conformant

Bespoke rules under detector clause 4.1 enter through `tsQaConfig/eslint.config.js`, which is merged into the resolved flat config, so any ESLint plugin object the project writes is a first-class defence. Clause 4.2 is met by `ts-qa rule <identifier> <path>`, which runs the ordinary lint lane over one path and reports whether that one rule fired, exiting 1 with locations when it did; a fixture carrying an `eslint-disable` comment made `ts-qa/no-eslint-disable` fire and a clean rule stay silent on the same file. Identifiers are `ts-qa/<name>`, chosen once in the plugin map and printed by ESLint with every finding, which is clause 4.3. Section 5 is met by the entry point, its `-p <path>` subset flag and the `--llm` verdict table, which names the failing tool and the path to the full result. Clauses 6.1 to 6.3 are met for every bundled plugin rule by `ts-qa rule-doc <identifier>`, which resolves the identifier exactly as printed to its section of the shipped `docs/cdd-rules.md` and prints it, offline, and a test in the suite walks every plugin rule to prove the page is there. That closes for the toolchain what ESLint alone fails, since ESLint's own rule pages are online only.

On the toolchain document, the listing under clauses 5.1 and 5.2 is `ts-qa rules`, which walks the resolved configuration and prints each active defence's identifier, severity, a terse description and the on-disk route, then the project record beneath it in the same listing; the repository's own rule against its own source appears alongside the bundled ones. The project record under 6.1 is `tsQaConfig/tier-a-exemptions.json`, loaded by the toolchain itself; an entry without a justification throws, and so do "legacy" and "needed for now", each rejection naming the entry and asking for the hazard and the scope, which is 6.2 ([configuration](https://github.com/LongTermSupport/ts-qa-ci/blob/main/docs/configuration.md)). Inline suppression is forbidden under 4.3 by `ts-qa/no-eslint-disable`, which fires on every `eslint-disable`, `oxlint-disable` and `@ts-` directive form and points the reader at the record. Clause 4.5 holds: phases 0 to 3 are detectors, phase 4 is the test runner, and a run that fails at phase 1 runs nothing after it. Clause 8.2 is the continuous integration workflow, which runs the toolchain on the package itself and fails on anything it cannot fix. The declaration under 9.2 is the `defenceBeforeFix` key in `package.json`, carrying both levels of clause 9.1 with their gaps recorded, so neither level claims conformance.

## How it is not conformant

Three causes, each verified through the entry point.

**The dependency-cruiser lane is outside the three commands.** The shipped `no-circular` defence prints its identifier with a two-file cycle and fails the run, but `ts-qa rule-doc no-circular` exits 2 as unknown, `ts-qa rules` does not list it, the lane ignores `-p`, and the release self-audit walks plugin rules only. Through the wrapping, dependency-cruiser fails detector clauses 4.2, 5.2 and 6.1, which fails toolchain 4.1, and the toolchain fails 4.2, 4.4, 5.1, 5.3 and 8.1 on the same fact. `ts-qa rule no-circular src` compounds it by answering "did not fire" with exit 0 for an identifier the harness cannot see.

**ESLint's bulk suppressions file is an open route.** A file containing the literal `PLACEHOLDER` fails the lint lane. With an `eslint-suppressions.json` in the project root naming that file and `ts-qa/no-placeholder`, the same run passes with every phase clean and the project record unchanged. Nothing disables the file or fails on its presence, so toolchain 4.3 fails, though every inline form is banned.

**Resolution of a core rule stops at a URL.** The always-on as/enum ban is routed through ESLint's `no-restricted-syntax`, and `ts-qa rule-doc no-restricted-syntax` resolves to a one-line description and eslint.org, not to the toolchain's own shipped page for the ban. Detector 6.2 and 6.3 fail for that identifier and toolchain 4.2 with them.

The derived listing also exposed a defect: `ts-qa/no-naive-datetime-template` is declared Tier A in the source and the documentation and is absent from the shipped generic configuration, so it is neither listed nor enforced anywhere, which fails 8.2 as a shipped rule inactive on the package itself. At project level, two of the bundled rules, `no-duplicate-section-ids` and `no-placeholder`, have no fixture test, so the red proof method clause 3.3 requires is not in the repository for them. Two SHOULDs remain open from the earlier audit: detector 4.4, a rule over the rules, and toolchain 7.2, since `deploy-skills` delivers static files rather than the generated listing.

| --------- | ------ | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Detector  | 4.1    | Yes     | `tsQaConfig/eslint.config.js` merged into the resolved config; a project dependency-cruiser config replaces the shipped one                     |
| Detector  | 4.2    | Partial | `ts-qa rule ts-qa/no-eslint-disable src/probe.ts` exited 1 with the location and a silent rule exited 0; no route for a dependency-cruiser rule |
| Detector  | 4.3    | Yes     | `ts-qa/<name>` chosen in the plugin map and printed unaltered; `no-circular` printed with its cycle                                             |
| Detector  | 4.4    | No      | No rule over the rules                                                                                                                          |
| Detector  | 5.1    | Yes     | `npx ts-qa`, no infrastructure                                                                                                                  |
| Detector  | 5.2    | Partial | `-p <path>` and the single-path `rule` command for the ESLint lane; the dependency-cruiser lane ignores `-p`                                    |
| Detector  | 5.3    | Yes     | `--llm` verdict table names the failing tool and the path to the full result                                                                    |
| Detector  | 5.4    | Yes     | CI runs the same command                                                                                                                        |
| Detector  | 6.1    | Partial | `rule-doc ts-qa/no-eslint-disable` printed the shipped section; `rule-doc no-circular` exited 2 as unknown                                      |
| Detector  | 6.2    | Partial | `docs/` ships and the printed route is a local path for plugin rules; a core rule resolves to eslint.org only                                   |
| Detector  | 6.3    | Partial | Every plugin rule has a section in `docs/cdd-rules.md`, pinned by a test; no page for `no-circular`, none shipped for core rules                |
| Detector  | 7.1    | Yes     | Directives detected by `ts-qa/no-eslint-disable`; the known-violations baseline needs a flag the toolchain never passes                         |
| Detector  | 7.2    | No      | A directive's reason is optional and a baseline entry carries none                                                                              |
| Toolchain | 4.1    | No      | dependency-cruiser plus the wrapping fails detector 4.2, 5.2 and 6.1 and a defence is routed through it                                         |
| Toolchain | 4.2    | No      | `no-circular` unresolvable; `no-restricted-syntax` resolves to an upstream URL, not the shipped as/enum ban page                                |
| Toolchain | 4.3    | No      | A `PLACEHOLDER` finding failed the lint lane; with `eslint-suppressions.json` naming it the run passed, all phases clean                        |
| Toolchain | 4.4    | No      | Entry point meets 5.1 to 5.4 for the ESLint lane; no subset for the dependency-cruiser lane                                                     |
| Toolchain | 4.5    | Yes     | Detectors in phases 0 to 3, tests in 4; a failure at phase 1 ran nothing after it                                                               |
| Toolchain | 5.1    | No      | `ts-qa rules` printed eighteen defences with identifier, description and route; `no-circular` absent                                            |
| Toolchain | 5.2    | Yes     | The listing walks the resolved ESLint configuration, and showed a declared Tier A rule that the configuration never enables                     |
| Toolchain | 5.3    | No      | The repository's own plugin rule is listed; its dependency-cruiser defence is not                                                               |

| Toolchain | 6.2    | Yes     | Missing, "legacy" and "needed for now" justifications each rejected with the entry named                                                        |
| Toolchain | 6.3    | Yes     | The project record is printed by `ts-qa rules` beneath the defences                                                                             |
| Toolchain | 6.4    | Yes     | The always-on tier and its reasoning are documented in `docs/cdd-rules.md` and `docs/coding-standards.md`                                       |
| Toolchain | 7.1    | Partial | One line per defence with identifier and route, phrased as a description                                                                        |
| Toolchain | 7.2    | Partial | `deploy-skills` delivers static skills, not the generated summary                                                                               |
| Toolchain | 8.1    | No      | The self-audit test walks plugin rules only; `no-circular` is outside it                                                                        |
| Toolchain | 8.2    | No      | CI runs the toolchain on itself, but `ts-qa/no-naive-datetime-template` ships and is active nowhere                                             |
| Toolchain | 9.2    | Yes     | `package.json` `defenceBeforeFix`: method 1.0.0, toolchain 0.2.0 at both levels, with the gaps above in `knownGaps`                             |
| Method 7  | 3.3    | Partial | Twenty-five bundled rules have a fixture test; `no-duplicate-section-ids` and `no-placeholder` have none                                        |
| Method 7  | record | Yes     | Two justified, scoped exemptions, printed on every run and by `rules`                                                                           |

## Notes for a practitioner

Install the package, run `npx ts-qa init` to scaffold `tsQaConfig/`, and write your defence as an ESLint plugin rule in `tsQaConfig/eslint.config.js` with a section in your own documentation, because that is the lane the harness, the resolver and the listing all cover. Prove it with `ts-qa rule <identifier> <fixture>`, check it appears in `ts-qa rules`, and put any irreducible exception in `tier-a-exemptions.json` with the hazard and scope written down, since the toolchain will reject anything less. Keep architectural rules in dependency-cruiser only if you are willing to document and prove them by hand, and do not let an `eslint-suppressions.json` into the repository, since the toolchain will not notice it for you yet.
